# Chat App

Scaffold for a simple chat application with a Node/Express/Socket.IO server and a Vite + React client.

Quick start

1. Install server deps:

```powershell
cd server
npm install
```

2. Install client deps:

```powershell
cd ../client
npm install
```

3. Run server and client in separate terminals:

```

Note: Update `server/.env` with `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET`.
